# Data Anlysis Projects
Here are some of my Data Analysis projects. 

1. [World Population and Poverty](./World%20Population%20and%20Poverty/)

    In this project, I explored data from [Gapminder.org](http://gapminder.org) to understand and analysis the world population and poverty.

2. [Climate Change - Temperatures and Precipitation](./Climate%20Change/)

    In this project, I investigated data on climate change, and the long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns.

3. [Movie Classification](./Movie%20Classification/)

    In this project, I built a classification model that guesses whether a movie is a comedy or a thriller by using only the number of times chosen words appear in the movie's screenplay.

Each folder contains my implementation of analysis (`.ipynb` file) and the datasets (`.csv` files).
